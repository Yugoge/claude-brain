# scripts

Maintenance and utility scripts for system operations

---

## Purpose

Central repository for all system automation scripts, organized by functional domain. Scripts provide reusable, parameterized logic for learning workflows, knowledge management, maintenance, and analytics.

## Structure

### Core Directories

- **archival/** - Save workflow scripts (Rem creation, relation discovery, validation)
- **review/** - FSRS review system scripts
- **learning-materials/** - Learning material processing (PDF extraction, progress tracking)
- **knowledge-graph/** - Graph operations (backlinks, normalization, inference)
- **analytics/** - Dashboard generation and statistics
- **validation/** - Data validation and consistency checks
- **maintenance/** - System maintenance and repair scripts
- **progress/** - Learning progress tracking and reporting

### Support Directories

- **agents/** - Agent consultation helpers
- **hooks/** - Hook implementation scripts
- **todo/** - TodoWrite workflow checklists
- **utils/** - Shared utilities (token estimation, file locking)
- **fact-check/** - Fact-checking workflow scripts
- **github/** - GitHub Pages deployment scripts
- **memory/** - MCP memory server utilities
- **mcp/** - MCP server integration scripts
- **services/** - External service integrations

### Legacy/Deprecated

- **archive/** - Historical scripts (preserved for reference)
- **deprecated/** - Deprecated scripts (kept for rollback)
- **fixes/** - One-time fix scripts
- **tests/** - Script test files
- **tmp/** - Temporary script development

## File Types

- `.py` - Python scripts (primary implementation language)
- `.sh` - Bash scripts (system operations)
- `.md` - Documentation files

## Organization Rules

1. **No inline code** - Commands must use scripts from this directory, never inline Python/bash
2. **Parameterized logic** - All scripts accept parameters (no hardcoded values)
3. **Proper imports** - Use `sys.path.append('scripts')` for cross-module imports
4. **Single responsibility** - Each script does one thing well
5. **Naming convention** - Use kebab-case for shell scripts, snake_case for Python
6. **Documentation** - Every script must have docstring/usage comment

## Standards

- **Python**: Follow PEP 8, use type hints, include docstrings
- **Bash**: Include usage comments, use `set -euo pipefail` for safety
- **Error handling**: All scripts must handle errors gracefully
- **Output format**: Prefer JSON for structured output
